Weather Prediction Classification Model
This project involves building a classification model to predict weather conditions using historical data. By implementing machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees and Random Forests, the model classifies various weather patterns to improve forecasting accuracy. The goal is to provide valuable insights for industries that rely on precise weather predictions.
